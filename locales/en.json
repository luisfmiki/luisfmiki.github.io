At this space I work with other undergrad students creating scientifc instrumentation (mainly) and physics demonstrations. Even though I think EITA! is a perfect enviroment for hands-on learning, I'm planning to do an internship by the year of 2024.\n The figures at this page shows some locations where I work/learn." ,
